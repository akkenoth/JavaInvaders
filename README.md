# JavaInvaders
A simple Java clone of Space Invaders game, made in MVC architecture using Observable/Observer and Swing.

## Requirements
* JDK 1.8+

## Compiling
* Preferred: open project with Intellij IDEA (project was made in IDEA 15 but should work in others too) and use provided build/use target
* Alternative: compile with ant using `pl/mbogusz3/JavaInvaders/build.xml` configuration file (NOT tested but should work)

## Documentation
Compile JavaDoc with:
```javadoc -d doc pl/mbogusz3/JavaInvaders/{,*/,*/*/}*.java```
(not the best script possible but enough) then open `doc/index.html` with your preferred browser.
